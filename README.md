#Hello My name is Saulo VinÃ­cius ðŸ––
Full-stack Developer | Music Producer | Designer
About me
I started my full-stack development journey in January 2023 at Coderhouse school. I have a background in HTML and CSS, and am continually improving my skills in this area. I'm currently taking a JavaScript course and I'm really enjoying exploring this domain.

At the same time, I have web development projects that help me improve my skills, and keep me more and more confident with html and css development. I am currently working on my personal pages, which involve my project as an electronic music producer and sound designer.

In the design area, I have experience working for electronic music parties and psychedelic designs for products such as visual identity, flyers, glasses, tickets, and t-shirts. I was also involved in digital video creation and editing projects for publicizing events and artists, as well as after movies of artist presentations and events in general.
